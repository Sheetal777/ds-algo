1. In for loops, initiation, verification and increment are all done in the same statement. The order in which these operations takes places are: 1. Initiation -> 2. Evaluation -> 3. Execution -> 4. Increment ->234..

Structure:
            int i = 1;
            do{
                System.out.println(i);
                i++;
            }while(i <= 10);

2. Post Increment and Pre Increment
    
        Frequently, you would be encountering statements such as i++, i--, ++i or --i.
        The former two statements are known as post increments/decrements while the latter two are known as pre increments/decrements.
    
        i++ and ++i is equivalent to i = i + 1.
        i-- and --i is equivalent to i = i - 1.
        i++ increments the value of 'i' by 1 but still uses the original value.
        ++i first increments the value of 'i' and then uses the value of the variable.
