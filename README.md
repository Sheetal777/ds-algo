# ds-algo

This Repo will have ds-algo questions practice in Java language predominantly. (C++ maybe)
Level 1: Beginner (285 questions)
Level 2: Intermediate (201 questions)
Level 3: Advanced (1 question)

My aim is to complete level one by February, 2021.

I am using pepcoding for tutorials + practice. 

ADVICE: (by Sumeet Sir, from pepcocding)

          1. Reminder on plan, focus and meditate. 
          2. Plan to avoid distractions, make it less likely to be distracted. 
          3. Focus while in the activity. Try hard to not leave it and do something else till the planned activity is done. 
          4. Meditate to stay mindful of the wandering mind. Keep bringing it back to where it should be.
